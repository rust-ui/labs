# General Purpose

This repository is designed to be a collaborative working space for creating components for Leptos and Dioxus.

It's only a temporary repository to test and develop components. Once they are ready, they are integrated directly into [Rust UI](https://rust-ui.com/).

# Setup

## Installation

Please refer to [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos?tab=readme-ov-file#nightly-note/) or [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-examples) documentation.


You will need these VSCode extensions:
- [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
- [Biome JS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)


Don't forget to :
- `rustup update`
- `cargo install-update -a`
- `cargo update`
  
- `git pull`



## Run the project

Please go inside 1-LEPTOS-UI-LABS or 2-DIOXUS-UI-LABS to see how to run the project.





# ðŸ’¡ Tips

When porting to Rust, don't forget to use the `Stylesheet` component to load the CSS.

Example:

```rs
view! {
    <Stylesheet href="/path/to/your/css/file.css" />
    // The rest of your component goes after 
    // ...
    // ...
}
```


If you need JS, in your component, don't forget to add the `script` tag. Usually, it's better to add it at the very end of the view macro to make sure the DOM is fully loaded.

Example:

```rs
view! {
  // ...
  // ...
  // The script goes at the end of the view macro
    <script src="/path/to/your/js/file.js"></script>
}
```


You can check the examples in the repo to see how it's used ðŸ˜„


## CSS


In the head of the index.html, make sure there is Tailwind CDN:

```html
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <!-- * TAILWIND CSS -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>
</head>
```



If possible, try to use `this__pattern` for custom CSS classes that you didn't manage to convert to Tailwind.
This way, we can distinguish them easily.

Example:

```css
.img__holder {
    clip-path: polygon(37.5% 20%, 62.5% 20%, 62.5% 80%, 37.5% 80%);
    transform: rotate(30deg);
}
```



## JS

At the moment, it's probably better to **keep the JS as it is** and not use Rust for interacting with the DOM.
While using wasm-bindgen or web_sys is possible, it seems overkill for the moment.

The main goal here is to convert index.html into reusable components in Rust.

If possible, you can try to use **inline JS** to avoid having a `script.js` file to manage.

Example:

Instead of having this:

```html
<button id="my__button">Show an alert</button>

<script>
  document.getElementById('my__button').addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert('Hello from JS!');
  });
</script>
```

Prefer to have this:

```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello from JS!');">
  "Show an alert"
</button>
```

PS: This is not mandatory, just a nice to have ðŸ˜„
