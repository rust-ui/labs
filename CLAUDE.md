# CLAUDE.md


## Instructions

- When modifying Rust code, **ALWAYS** run `cargo check` after your changes to verify all is good.
- DO **NOT** mention `Claude Code` in the commits you create.
- When working with signals, **ALWAYS** use `RwSignal::new()`.
- Whenever you ask a question, prepend with: `ðŸ¤”`.
- **NEVER** add classes to body. Use a div for that.
