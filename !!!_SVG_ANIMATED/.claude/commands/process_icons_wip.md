## Instructions


1. Identify the agents you will need to complete exactly @ANIMATION_CONVERSION_PROCESS.md for each `.txt` files in `./ICONS_WIP`.
2. Run them in parallel to follow exactly @ANIMATION_CONVERSION_PROCESS.md for each `.txt` files in `./ICONS_WIP`. Please make sure to tell each agent to FIRST read carefully the all @ANIMATION_CONVERSION_PROCESS.md, and then to process the conversion. They must pay very close attention to edge cases and make sure to follow the instructions of the .md file.
3. When all agents are done, make sure all icons are added in `./SVG-ANIMATED.html` in `loadIcons()`. Add them under a comment `// NEW ICONS`.
