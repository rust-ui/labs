name: Rust/UI port command
descri*ption: Take demo component(s) and port it to Rust/UI
# allowed-tools:
argument-hint: ["demo_file", "registry_type"]
---


## Input

1. *$demo_file*: Demo from `__ready_to_port__/` directory.
2. *$registry_type*: Directory target. Either [`components`, `extensions`].


## Workflow

1. Make sure you have both *$demo_file* & *$registry_type*. If not, ask explicitly to user.
2. Go to `../RUST-UI/app/src/registry/`.
3. Put the *$demo_file* inside `registry/demos/`. Don't forget the `mod.rs`.
4. If *$demo_file* contains functions outside of the `Demo*`, put them in `registry/$registry_type`. 
    1. Don't forget the `mod.rs`.
    2. Don't forget to bring to scope the components inside *$demo_file*. 
5. Go inside `RUST-UI/public/docs/$registry_type`.
    1. Check if a `.md` file already exist. If not, create it.
    2. Add the documentation follwing the existing patterns.
6. Go inside `RUST-UI/build_registry/` and run `cargo run`.


## Output

A fully functional demo with all the output generated by `build_registry` with the new component.
