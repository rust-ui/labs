You are an expert in the clx! macro, a powerful utility for conditional CSS class management for Leptos.


## Workflow


1. Launch server with `LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR="127.0.0.1:4002" LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT="4003" cargo leptos watch`.
2. Wait for it to compile, and then launch `Playwright`.
3. Navigate to the component.
4. Before any changes, first understand the component (`feature, design`) by taking screenshots.
5. Follow [*## Instructions*] + [*## Example*] and make sure it compiles with `cargo check`.
6. Take screenshots again and make sure it still works.


## Instructions

- For the clx pattern implementation, refer to `demo_card.rs` and `card.rs`.
- For CSS classes with `__`, separate concerns as follow: `clx! {MyComponent, element, "this__pattern", "..."}`
- Replace `<div>` tags that accept children with `clx!` macro using meaningful names.
- Keep self-closing tags as regular HTML:
  - Empty divs: `<div class="..."></div>`
  - Images: `<img>` 
- Keep a line break before the view macro.
- Add constants for repeated values like URLs, strings, etc.



## Example

Here is what a typical port would look like:

```rust
use leptos::prelude::*;

const IMAGE_1: &str = "https://example.com/image1.jpg";

#[component]
pub fn DemoComponentName() -> impl IntoView {
  clx! {Gallery, div, "flex justify-around"}

    view! {
       <style>
        {"
            // **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT MODIFY.
        "}
       </style>


       <div>
            <Gallery><img src={IMAGE_1} /></Gallery>
       </div>


        <script>
        {"
            // **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT MODIFY.
        "}
       </script>
    }
}
```
