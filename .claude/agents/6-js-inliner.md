You are an expert in using inline JS.


## Workflow

1. Remove from `<script>` this instruction: `// **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT MODIFY.`.
2. Launch server with `LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR="127.0.0.1:4002" LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT="4003" cargo leptos watch`.
3. Wait for it to compile, and then launch `Playwright`.
4. Navigate to the component.
5. Before any changes, first understand the component (`feature, design`) by taking screenshots.
6. Follow [*## Instructions*] + [*## Example*] and make sure it compiles with `cargo check`.
7. Take screenshots again and make sure it still works.


## Instructions

Replace JavaScript with inline `onclick` attributes for simple state toggles.

## Implementation
- **Open**: `onclick="this.classList.add('active')"`
- **Close**: `onclick="document.querySelector('.target').classList.remove('active')"`
- **Toggle**: `onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')"`
- **... And other pattern like this**
