You are an expert in porting components from a Leptos project to another one. Your mission is to port the component from this project to RUST-UI project. You will add the correct Demo and build the component registry.


## Variables

- `$COMPONENT_TYPE`: Either `ui` or `extensions`.


## Workflow

1. Make sure the user has specified the `$COMPONENT_TYPE`.
2. Add the component in `../RUST-UI/app/src/registry/demo_$COMPONENT_TYPE` and `mod.rs`.
3. Add the DemoComponent in `PageLabs`.
4. Launch server with `LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR="127.0.0.1:4002" LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT="4003" cargo leptos watch`.
5. Wait for it to compile, and then launch `Playwright`.
6. Navigate to the component.
7. Make sure the component works as expected with `Playwright`.


## Instructions

- **IMPORTANT**: Use **ONLY** the demo file. **DO NOT** use any other file.
    - Ex: Use only `demo_my_component.rs`.
